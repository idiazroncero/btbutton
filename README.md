# btbutton for Bootstrap 4

This is a CKEditor4 Bootstrap4 button widget, forked from https://github.com/smonetti/btbutton, refactored and adapted to Bootstrap 4.

It will allow the users to insert a link styled as a [Bootstrap Button](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/), with access to all
Bootstrap button types an sizes.

The dialog also allows the user to select the link target and to optionally append or prepend an icon. The icon library has to be already present on the page, this plugin will only insert an HTML element on the selected position with some classes.
